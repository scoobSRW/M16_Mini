Installation
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.11 or above
pip for managing Python packages
PostgreSQL (if running locally)
git (optional, for cloning the repository)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/scoobSRW/M16_Mini.git
cd M16_Mini
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Setup Environment Variables
Make sure to create a .env file in the project root and add your environment variables, such as your database URI and any API keys:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Example .env
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
Configuration
This project uses a Config class in the config.py file to manage configurations such as the database URI and secret keys. You can modify this file to adjust settings for development, testing, or production.

python
Copy
Edit
class Config:
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname'
    SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'
Running the App Locally
To run the application locally in development mode, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run.py
This will start the Flask development server. You can access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Testing
This project includes unit tests that can be run using the unittest framework.

To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run.py
This will run the tests in the tests directory and print the results to the console.

Deployment
Deployment on Render
Push your repository to GitHub if it’s not already.
Go to Render and create a new web service.
Connect your GitHub repository and choose the correct branch.
Set the build and start commands:
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: gunicorn run:app
Set any environment variables required for the app, such as the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI.
Click "Deploy" to deploy the app.
Once the app is deployed, it will be accessible via the provided Render URL.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, here are a few things to check:

Database Connection: Ensure that your database URI is correctly set and that the database is accessible.
Error Logs: Review the logs for more detailed error messages. If using Render, you can check the logs on the Render dashboard.
Gunicorn: If Gunicorn isn’t starting the app properly, ensure that the start command in your Render configuration points to the correct app instance (e.g., run:app).
